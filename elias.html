        <h1> This site is a consistent work in progress, and some areas may not function exactly as intended. More frequent updates occur when there are less demands from work and school.</h1>
        <p>Problems herby is aware of: Homepage links to blog sections does not take you to a landing page. Leaf covers up herby's name title on mobile (need to scale it down for mobile). Planner does not work (it is using a Wordpress theme and has no functional coding).</p>
