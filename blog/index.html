<!--
Sections for school writing samples, coding projects, and other by tag.
Load posts onto this page instead of loading new pages?
Choose between markdown and plain code
Find way for text highlighting of code; might need to write up stylesheet specifically for allowing code highlighting.
Might work better to learn XSL and use that to write up pages properly
Maybe add pages each time so they have their own URL and just use XML DOM to describe the layout
Currently Wordpress is going to be removed from the site.
Need an XML attribute to specify the date it was written (not time), even going backwards in time
Perhaps a secondary time attribute that says the date it was posted, allowing for searching posts by time?
Tags that describe the topic of the post
Search by tag through posts by having a meta tag on each page created from the list of tags in the post XML data
Show tags in the top title area underneath the title, then date originally finished and data posted below that,
then the actual post below that.
minimalistic, nothing to the sides during reading, and below can suggest other posts under tags the post matches
if no others by that tag, a link to a list of all posts

A script for server side that searches all the posts that haven't gotten an HTML file yet (page) and reports which ones need to be added.
