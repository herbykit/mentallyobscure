# Coping Bag

## Designing the Values Sorting Tool
The Values Sorting Tool started as an XML file formatted with XSL, that I then transitioned into a JSON file which is read by JS in the HTML webpage. It is designed to be just as simple to use on mobile as on desktop with abilities appropriate for both platforms available.

## Creating a prototype of the Coping Bag future design
As the current design is simplified greatly in order to make the Values Sorting Tool accessible from navigating the website, I took the time to create a prototype of what the page would need to look like in the future. Through Canva, I designed a simplified and efficient design to improve ease of use while offering more utility. As a prototype, it is not necessarily precisely the same as the final product, but allows for a stable reference when creating the prototype in code.
