      <h2><b>Mental Illness: The Research on Developmental Trauma - a guide</b></h2>
      <div class="fullscreen">
        <h3>So what is developmental trauma? Isn't trauma just trauma?</h3>
        Developmental trauma is a form of childhood trauma that effects their development negatively, such as in physical growth, emotional connection, and social skills.<br /><br />
        Related terms to developmental trauma include: early childhood trauma <b>(often used as a synonym)</b>, and adverse childhood experiences <b>(ACEs, a descriptor of childhood trauma)</b>. Read more about the terms related to this experience written about by <a href="https://www.nctsn.org/sites/default/files/resources/glossary_of_terms_related_to_trauma-Informed_integrated_healthcare.pdf">The National Child Traumatic Stress Network</a> and another glossary developed by mental health specialists at <a href="https://www.complextrauma.org/glossary/">complextrauma.org</a>.
        <h3>Pathfinder Purpose</h3><br />
        This guide is intended to assist with researching about how developmental trauma can effect people from a young age through the rest of the person's life, from neuroscience to psychology.
        <br />
        <h3>Target Audience</h3><br />
        As a user of Davidson Davie Community College materials, this guide can help you with learning about the research available about developmental trauma, especially for those that expect work in medical or social professions. <br />
        Due to the nature of this type of trauma, it effects a person in many contexts, including educationally, socially, emotionally, and relationally.<br /><br />
        Example topics that would be involved with this form of research include:
      </div>

      <div class="fullscreen fix-center">

              When writing a paper about mental wellness or mental illness, this type of experience deeply effects the mental states of those experiencing it, making it a valuable topic to consider.<br /><br />
              From depression to less common mental illness, there is plenty of information available to consider this experience within your writing. Even if you are unfamiliar with mental health, dipping into the current research is useful for classes like HEA110 and PSY150.
            </td>
            <td>
              Due to the effect trauma has on the body, from the brain to the stomach, many physically painful symptoms are effected by trauma, especially when it occurs repeatedly in early childhood (van der Kolk, 2015).<br /><br />
              Considering your field, if you interact with those that may be in pain often, exploring this topic may help with understanding the depth at which it effects the human system. Having a baseline for your work rooted in current research is important for improved outcomes, especially those in health and medical programs.

              Trauma at the age where every child is developing their basic skills has a profound effect on the psychosocial development of the child (Psychol, 2013).<br /><br />
              Learning about the research that talks about what this looks like is valuable for improving communication and promoting learning social skills that may not have been learned earlier on, especially for those in the Early Childhood Education program.
