    <description>618.92 Perry<br />Focused on how trauma effects children, this covers many stories in detail from which people have faced during their younger years. Covers topics interpretively such as the neuroscience and developmental theory behind how trauma effects a person, especially those who are children. This is written narratively, and covers many forms of trauma, but brings home a clear message about resilience and recovering from trauma.</description>

    <name>Toxic parents : overcoming their hurtful legacy and reclaiming your life by Forward, Susan</name>
    <link>https://noca.ent.sirsi.net/client/en_US/davidson/search/detailnonmodal/ent:$002f$002fSD_ILS$002f0$002fSD_ILS:1254511/one</link>
    <description>362.829 Forward DAVIE<br/>For those that have struggled through childhood with maltreatment, this gives context to how the trauma is not the child's fault. For those in education, medical fields, or generally researching about trauma, this can give context to what abuse and neglect does, and signs to listen for people casually mentioning that indicate that home was not or is not safe.</description>

    <description>1999, Davidson, 305.23 Kindlon<br/>2000, Davie, 305.23 Kindlon DAVIE<br/>The context that boys grow up in commonly forces them to reject their own emotions and not develop emotional literacy. For those who work with boys, this supplements knowledge about improving children's emotional literacy and addressing this at school and home.</description>

    <description>362.7 Pel DAVIE<br/>Covers an extreme case of child abuse, discussing the events of what happened clearly. Using this as a resource for having clear trauma experiences to refer to can solidify understanding of other materials discussing working with others who have experienced forms of trauma such as abuse and neglect. Despite it being extreme, it also can give context to individual events that may lead to developmental trauma.</description>

    <description>F Wal<br/>Even though this is fiction, it provides insight into how sexual abuse effects those who experience it, especially the sense of isolation. When working with those who have been abused, this is a viewport into how abuse changes a person's abilities to speak for themselves through the training by those who abused them into believing no one will help.</description>
