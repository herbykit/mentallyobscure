## Task Management - Colours
This tool is one I plan to document the process I go through in designing different prototypes of interfaces and their functions - from writing up the process of design decisions and functions necessary, to using simple tools such as Canva or Google Slides for a simple prototype, to using the prototype design as a reference for the basic framework in code.

The next step is to design the colours display on the main page, then create the elements of which I will use JS to insert them automatically from whichever form of data storage is used.

An essential part of designing this tool is set in the form of data storage used - within the process of making the first steps of the prototype, I found that it would be most effective to use a database server-side for this project.
