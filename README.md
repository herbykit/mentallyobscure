This originated as a website portfolio for herby, but developed into an ongoing project where they could create prototypes and finalise those prototypes to be useful tools for those dealing with mental illness and neurodevelopmental challenges.

A wide variety of languages and tools are used for this website - HTML, CSS, and JS are essential, but JSON, XML, XSL, and some other languages are used in regards to what the specific task needs. Due to working fulltime, herby will slowly develop this resource alongside creating a clear wiki which explains the process used to create these tools - documentation is essential to enabling a project to continue years down the road.

# [Homepage](https://mentallyobscure.org)
This page uses no XML, and redirects to each other page. It purposely doesn't link to the ECU portfolio part of the website, but the ECU subdomain links back to the homepage.

# [ECU](https://ecu.mentallyobscure.org)
This subdomain is a website that contains all of the graduate school projects I've been able to turn into website form, where I practice using skills I learn in the other projects I do in a more efficient manner.

# [ADHD](https://adhd.mentallyobscure.org)
This subdomain contains my projects related to managing ADHD - currently, this only has the framework for an ADHD task management tool where users can collect colours as rewards for their effort. 

# [Bag](https://bag.mentallyobscure.org)
This subdomain contains a collection of coping resources that is intends to slowly fill up with tools, guides, and skills for users to refer to. In the future, it will offer a way to store (in the browser) preferred resources and sort resources by categories.
