This is a portfolio website used to share and explore different things herby works on as small projects, including some graduate school assignments and projects.

It is designed with the intention of understanding the backbone of how each language used works, with high focus on Javascript, XSL, and CSS.

# [Homepage](http://mentallyobscure.org)
This page uses no XML, and redirects to each other page. It purposely doesn't link to the ECU portfolio part of the website, but the ECU subdomain links back to the homepage.

# [Blog](http://blog.mentallyobscure.org)
This subdomain will use both Javascript and XML + XSL for providing the pages. Backend code will be used to generate RSS feeds for the different sections of the blog.

Still determining if actual posts will be hosted on Github in addition to on the site's server itself.

# [Styleguides](http://style.mentallyobscure.org)
This subdomain is a personalised guide to three common styleguides - mainly intended for use for graduate school projects, but preferably organised a bit more clearly than other styleguide websites for those who mainly use electronic resources.

# [Planner](http://plan.mentallyobscure.org)
This subdomain is a project on pause that is primarily focused on storing recipes and managing kitchen supplies. [Originally written in Javascript](https://github.com/herbykit/planner), it needs to be rewritten to store saved data in XML for readibility.

# [ECU](http://ecu.mentallyobscure.org)
This subdomain is a website that contains all of the graduate school projects I've been able to turn into website form, where I practice using skills I learn in the other projects I do in a more efficient manner.
